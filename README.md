# Secure Cloud Storage using OpenSSL - Applied Cryptography Project

This project is the implementation of a secure cloud storage service that leverages OpenSSL library. This project was completed as part of the Applied Cryptography course in the MSc Cybersecurity degree at the University of Pisa.

## Project Description

This cloud storage service aims to provide heightened security for data stored in the cloud via the OpenSSL library. It stores data in an encrypted format, making it difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information.
